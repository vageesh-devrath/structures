# Structures
## Aim:-Use a Structure to display the student details
### Theory:-
      Structure is a user-defined datatype in C language which allows us to combine data of different types together. Structure helps to         construct a complex data type which is more meaningful. It is somewhat similar to an Array, but an array holds data of similar type         only. But structure on the other hand, can store data of any type, which is practical more useful.
#### Algorithm:-
          1)Start
          2)struct s{"Statements"};\
          3)int main(){"Statements"
	                  for(i=0;i<n;i++)
	                   {"Statements"}
                         if(ch==0)
                          {"Statements"}
          4)for(i=0;i<n;i++){"Display"}	
	  5)End
##### Conclusion:- 
               from this program learnt what is the function of structures and how it can be used to display different detials accordingly.
